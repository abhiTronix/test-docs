    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about
    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.

    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with
    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.

    If the important info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label 
    or may choose to close the issue until there is enough information provided.
